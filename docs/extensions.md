# zot extensions

zot can be extended with custom slash commands by running an external
program as a subprocess and exchanging newline-delimited JSON over
its stdin/stdout. Extensions can be written in **any language** that
can read and write JSON lines from stdio — Go, TypeScript, Python,
Rust, shell with `jq`, anything.

Four phases shipped so far:

- **Phase 1**: slash commands + chat notifications.
- **Phase 2**: tools the LLM can call.
- **Phase 3**: lifecycle event subscriptions + tool-call interception
  for guardrail extensions.
- **Phase 4**: interactive extension-owned panels rendered inside zot.
- **Theme-only extensions**: ship `theme.json` without launching a
  subprocess. See [themes.md](themes.md).

## Quick start

The simplest extension is a script that prints a hello frame, reads
commands, and prints responses. Here's the whole thing in **Python**,
no SDK required:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# $ZOT_HOME/extensions/hello-py/hello.py
import json, sys, threading

def emit(obj):
    sys.stdout.write(json.dumps(obj) + "\n")
    sys.stdout.flush()

emit({"type":"hello","name":"hello-py","version":"1.0.0","capabilities":["commands"]})
emit({"type":"register_command","name":"hellopy","description":"say hi (python)"})

for line in sys.stdin:
    msg = json.loads(line)
    if msg["type"] == "command_invoked":
        emit({"type":"command_response","id":msg["id"],"action":"prompt",
              "prompt": "Greet me very briefly. Add one emoji."})
    elif msg["type"] == "shutdown":
        emit({"type":"shutdown_ack"})
        break
```

Drop it in a directory with this `extension.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "hello-py",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "exec": "./hello.py",
  "language": "python",
  "enabled": true
}
```

`exec` is required for protocol extensions. If an extension only ships
`theme.json` or `themes/theme.json`, no `exec` is required and zot does
not spawn a subprocess.

`chmod +x hello.py`, install:

```bash
zot ext install ./hello-py
```

Restart `zot`, type `/hellopy`, the agent greets you. Done.

## Built-in extensions

**zot ships with no extensions installed by default.** A fresh `zot install` (or `go install`) gives you a clean agent. Extensions are entirely opt-in: you install (or `--ext` for one run) only the ones you want.

The `examples/extensions/` directory in the repo is reference code, not a default install set. To use any of those:

```bash
# go-based examples need a build first
cd path/to/zot/examples/extensions/hello && go build -o hello .

# install (copies to $ZOT_HOME/extensions/hello/)
zot ext install path/to/zot/examples/extensions/hello

# or load straight from the repo for one zot session
zot --ext path/to/zot/examples/extensions/hello
```

Nothing is auto-installed and nothing reaches out to the network without your explicit action.

## Layout & discovery

zot scans two directories on startup, in this order:

1. **Project-local**: `./.zot/extensions/<name>/extension.json`
2. **Global**: `$ZOT_HOME/extensions/<name>/extension.json`

A project-local extension with the same name wins over a global one.
On macOS `$ZOT_HOME` defaults to `~/Library/Application Support/zot/`;
on Linux it's `$XDG_STATE_HOME/zot` or `~/.local/state/zot`.

Because each extension owns its own directory, the recommended place
for extension state is inside that directory itself (for example
`todos.json`, `settings.json`, or an auth/cache file used only by that
extension). The host also passes this path back in `hello_ack` as
`extension_dir` / `data_dir` so runtime code does not need to guess it.

Each extension owns its own subdirectory. The `extension.json`
manifest tells zot how to launch it:

```json
{
  "name": "weather",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "exec": "./weather",
  "args": ["--mode", "daemon"],
  "language": "go",
  "description": "current weather for any city",
  "enabled": true
}
```

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `name` | required. how zot identifies the extension; must match what's sent in the `hello` frame. |
| `version` | optional. shown in `zot ext list`. |
| `exec` | required. path to the executable (relative to the manifest). |
| `args` | optional. extra argv passed to `exec`. |
| `language` | optional. informational only (`go`, `python`, `typescript`, ...). |
| `description` | optional. shown in `zot ext list`. |
| `enabled` | optional, defaults to `true`. set to `false` to disable without removing. |

## Lifecycle

1. **Discovery**: zot reads every `extension.json` in the search dirs.
2. **Spawn**: enabled extensions are launched as subprocesses. stderr
   redirects to `$ZOT_HOME/logs/ext-<name>.log` (one file per
   extension, append-mode).
3. **Hello handshake**: the extension sends a `hello` frame; zot
   replies with `hello_ack` containing the protocol version, the
   active provider/model/cwd, and the extension's own data directory
   so it can persist files beside its manifest.
4. **Registration**: the extension sends `register_command` frames.
   First-come-first-served: a name already taken by a built-in or by
   a previously-loaded extension is silently shadowed (logged in the
   extension's own log file).
5. **Runtime**: zot dispatches `command_invoked` frames when the
   user runs a registered command; the extension responds with
   `command_response`. Extensions can also push `notify` frames at
   any time. Panel-capable extensions may open an interactive panel,
   receive key events, and push redraws while the panel is focused.
6. **Shutdown**: when zot exits, it sends `shutdown` and waits up to
   2s for the extension to send `shutdown_ack`. Holdouts are
   SIGTERM'd, then SIGKILL'd.

A crashing extension does not bring down zot. The slash command it
owned simply stops working until the extension is fixed and zot is
restarted.

## Wire format

All frames are one JSON object per line. Top-level `type` is the
discriminator. Optional `id` correlates request frames with their
responses.

### Extension → host

#### `hello` (required, first frame)

```json
{"type":"hello","name":"weather","version":"1.0.0",
 "capabilities":["commands","tools","panels"]}
```

#### `register_command`

```json
{"type":"register_command","name":"weather",
 "description":"current weather for a city"}
```

#### `register_tool`

Registers a tool the LLM can call. `schema` is a JSON Schema object
describing the tool's args (the same shape Anthropic and OpenAI accept).

```json
{"type":"register_tool","name":"weather",
 "description":"Get the current weather for a city.",
 "schema":{
   "type":"object",
   "properties":{"city":{"type":"string"}},
   "required":["city"]
 }}
```

Tool names live in the same namespace as built-in tools (`read`,
`write`, `edit`, `bash`, `skill`). Conflicts are silently shadowed by
the built-in.

#### `ready`

Sentinel telling zot "all initial registrations are flushed". Send it
right after your last `register_*` frame so the host can build the
agent's tool registry without racing the registration window.

```json
{"type":"ready"}
```

#### `tool_result`

Reply to a `tool_call` from the host. `content[]` is a list of
message blocks; each block is `{"type":"text","text":"..."}` or
`{"type":"image","mime_type":"image/png","data":"<base64>"}`. Set
`is_error: true` to mark the call as failed.

```json
{"type":"tool_result","id":"...",
 "content":[{"type":"text","text":"Berlin: 16°C, fog"}]}
```

#### `subscribe`

Declares which lifecycle events the extension wants to observe and
which it wants to intercept. Send once after `hello`, before `ready`.

```json
{"type":"subscribe",
 "events":["session_start","turn_start","tool_call","turn_end","assistant_message"],
 "intercept":["tool_call","turn_start","assistant_message"]}
```

Recognised event names: `session_start`, `turn_start`, `turn_end`,
`tool_call`, `assistant_message`.

Interceptable events:

- `tool_call`: block the call (model sees `reason` as the tool
  error) or rewrite args via `modified_args`.
- `turn_start`: block the turn before the model is called. Useful
  for rate-limiting and business-hour gates. `reason` is shown to
  the user as a status line. No rewrite supported.
- `assistant_message`: suppress the message via `block`, or rewrite
  the user-visible text via `replace_text`. The model's original
  text stays in the transcript so the model sees what it actually
  said on subsequent turns.

#### `event_intercept_response`

Reply to an `event_intercept` from the host. All fields default to
"allow, pass through unmodified".

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `block` | `true` refuses the action. For `tool_call`, `reason` is shown to the model; for `turn_start` / `assistant_message`, `reason` is shown to the user. |
| `reason` | refusal text (on block) or pass-through note. |
| `modified_args` | for `tool_call`: rewritten JSON args the tool will actually see. Must be a valid JSON object. Ignored when `block` is true. |
| `replace_text` | for `assistant_message`: replaces the user-visible text. The model's original output still lives in the transcript. Ignored when `block` is true. |

Missing the response within 5s is treated as "allow" (i.e. an
unresponsive extension never stalls the agent). When multiple
extensions subscribe to the same event, they're consulted serially;
the first `block` wins and rewrites (args / text) chain: each
subsequent interceptor sees the previous one's output.

```json
{"type":"event_intercept_response","id":"...",
 "block":true,"reason":"refused: matches danger pattern \"rm -rf\""}

{"type":"event_intercept_response","id":"...",
 "modified_args":{"command":"echo GUARDED: ls"}}

{"type":"event_intercept_response","id":"...",
 "replace_text":"[redacted]"}
```

#### `command_response` (reply to `command_invoked`)

```json
{"type":"command_response","id":"...","action":"prompt",
 "prompt":"Show today's weather for Berlin in one line."}
```

`action` is one of:

- `"prompt"` — submits `prompt` as a fresh user message; the agent
  runs a turn against it.
- `"insert"` — inserts `insert` into the editor at the cursor without
  submitting.
- `"display"` — appends `display` to the chat as a one-shot styled
  note. No model call, nothing written to the transcript.
- `"open_panel"` — opens an extension-owned interactive panel inside
  zot. The panel content lives in `open_panel`.
- `"noop"` — the extension handled it itself (e.g. it pushed
  `notify` frames or kicked off background work). zot doesn't change
  the UI in response.

Example:

```json
{"type":"command_response","id":"...","action":"open_panel",
 "open_panel":{
   "id":"todos-main",
   "title":"Todos",
   "lines":["□ ship panel api","✓ persist state"],
   "footer":"↑/↓ navigate - a add - x complete - esc close"
 }}
```

If `error` is non-empty, zot renders it as a red status line
regardless of `action`.

#### `panel_render` (one-way, while a panel is open)

Pushes a fresh frame for an already-open panel.

```json
{"type":"panel_render","panel_id":"todos-main",
 "title":"Todos",
 "lines":["□ ship panel api","✓ persist state"],
 "footer":"↑/↓ navigate - a add - x complete - esc close"}
```

#### `panel_close`

Closes a previously-open panel.

```json
{"type":"panel_close","panel_id":"todos-main"}
```

#### `notify` (one-way, any time)

```json
{"type":"notify","level":"info",
 "message":"refreshed cache (12 entries)"}
```

`level` is one of `info`, `success`, `warn`, `error`. The note shows
up below the transcript with the extension's name in brackets.

#### `shutdown_ack`

Sent in response to `shutdown`. Extension should exit promptly after.

### Host → extension

#### `hello_ack`

```json
{"type":"hello_ack","protocol_version":1,
 "zot_version":"0.0.7","provider":"anthropic",
 "model":"claude-opus-4-7","cwd":"/Users/pat/Developer/zot",
 "extension_dir":"/Users/pat/Developer/zot/.zot/extensions/todos",
 "data_dir":"/Users/pat/Developer/zot/.zot/extensions/todos"}
```

Sent immediately after `hello`. The extension can use these fields to
decide which commands to register (e.g. only register a Python tool
on macOS, only register a model-specific shortcut for opus, etc.).
`extension_dir` / `data_dir` are where the extension should persist
its own state (for example `todos.json`, cached metadata, or auth
tokens scoped to that extension).

#### `command_invoked`

```json
{"type":"command_invoked","id":"...",
 "name":"weather","args":"berlin"}
```

`args` is everything the user typed after the command name, trimmed.

#### `tool_call`

Sent when the LLM invokes a tool the extension registered. `args` is
the parsed JSON object the model produced; the extension is
responsible for validating/coercing it.

```json
{"type":"tool_call","id":"...","name":"weather",
 "args":{"city":"Berlin"}}
```

Reply with `tool_result` within the host's tool timeout (default 60s).
Missing the timeout surfaces an error to the model and the call is
marked as failed.

#### `event`

Lifecycle notification for events the extension subscribed to via
`subscribe`. One-way — no response expected.

```json
{"type":"event","event":"turn_start","step":1}
{"type":"event","event":"tool_call",
 "tool_id":"...","tool_name":"read","tool_args":{"path":"foo.go"}}
{"type":"event","event":"turn_end","stop":"end_turn"}
```

#### `event_intercept`

Sent when zot wants to give the extension a chance to block, modify,
or annotate a lifecycle event before it happens. Reply with
`event_intercept_response` within 5s; missing the deadline is
treated as "allow".

Payload fields depend on the event:

```json
// tool_call: includes the tool id, name, and parsed args
{"type":"event_intercept","id":"...","event":"tool_call",
 "tool_id":"...","tool_name":"bash",
 "tool_args":{"command":"rm -rf /tmp/foo"}}

// turn_start: includes the step number
{"type":"event_intercept","id":"...","event":"turn_start",
 "step":3}

// assistant_message: includes the assembled text
{"type":"event_intercept","id":"...","event":"assistant_message",
 "text":"here is your api key: sk-ant-..."}
```

#### `panel_key`

Sent while an extension-owned panel is focused. `key` is a normalized
name (`up`, `down`, `left`, `right`, `enter`, `esc`, `tab`, `pageup`,
`pagedown`, `home`, `end`, `backspace`, `delete`, `rune`). For
`key:"rune"`, `text` carries the typed character.

```json
{"type":"panel_key","panel_id":"todos-main","key":"down"}
{"type":"panel_key","panel_id":"todos-main","key":"rune","text":"x"}
```

#### `panel_close`

Sent when the user closes the focused panel from zot (for example with
Esc or Ctrl+C). The extension should treat this as the panel lifetime
ending and stop sending `panel_render` updates for that `panel_id`.

```json
{"type":"panel_close","panel_id":"todos-main"}
```

#### `shutdown`

Sent during graceful zot exit (or `/reload-ext` once that lands).
Reply with `shutdown_ack` and then exit.

## Managing extensions from the CLI

```
zot ext list                    list installed extensions and their state
zot ext install <path|git-url>  copy / clone into $ZOT_HOME/extensions/
zot ext remove <name>           delete an extension directory
zot ext enable <name>           re-enable a disabled extension
zot ext disable <name>          disable without removing
zot ext logs <name> [-f]        cat / tail the extension's stderr
```

`zot ext install <path>` does a recursive copy; `<git-url>` does a
shallow clone. Both validate that the destination contains an
`extension.json` and roll back if not.

## Loading an extension for one run

For iteration on a working copy, skip the install + reload cycle
and load straight from disk for one zot session:

```
zot --ext ./my-extension        # short form: -e ./my-extension
zot --ext ./a -e ./b            # repeatable
```

`--ext` paths take precedence over installed extensions of the same
name, so you can shadow an installed copy with a work-in-progress
version without uninstalling first. Nothing is copied or persisted;
the extension dies with zot like any other subprocess.

## SDKs

Writing the wire protocol by hand is fine for one-off scripts, but
for anything bigger the SDKs handle the boilerplate.

### Go — `packages/agent/ext`

```go
package main

import (
    "encoding/json"
    "github.com/patriceckhart/zot/packages/agent/ext"
)

func main() {
    e := ext.New("hello", "1.0.0")

    // Slash command
    e.Command("hello", "say hi", func(args string) ext.Response {
        return ext.Prompt("Greet me in one short sentence.")
    })

    // LLM-callable tool
    e.Tool("weather", "Current weather for a city.",
        json.RawMessage(`{"type":"object","properties":{"city":{"type":"string"}},"required":["city"]}`),
        func(args json.RawMessage) ext.ToolResult {
            var in struct{ City string `json:"city"` }
            json.Unmarshal(args, &in)
            return ext.TextResult(in.City + ": sunny")
        })

    e.Run()
}
```

Build with `go build -o hello .`, drop the binary + an `extension.json`
into `$ZOT_HOME/extensions/hello/`.

The SDK has four interceptor hooks, all optional:

```go
// e is the *ext.Extension returned by ext.New(...).

// Refuse calls or rewrite args before they run.
e.InterceptToolCall(func(tool string, args json.RawMessage) (bool, string) {
    if tool == "bash" { /* inspect args, return false, reason */ }
    return true, ""
})

// Richer variant: returns ToolCallDecision so you can also rewrite
// args via ModifiedArgs.
e.InterceptToolCallX(func(tool string, args json.RawMessage) ext.ToolCallDecision {
    return ext.ToolCallDecision{
        ModifiedArgs: json.RawMessage(`{"command":"echo GUARDED"}`),
    }
})

// Block the next turn before the model is called.
e.InterceptTurnStart(func(step int) ext.TurnStartDecision {
    if time.Now().Hour() < 9 { return ext.TurnStartDecision{Block: true, Reason: "outside business hours"} }
    return ext.TurnStartDecision{}
})

// Scrub or rewrite the assistant's final text before the user sees it.
e.InterceptAssistantMessage(func(text string) ext.AssistantMessageDecision {
    return ext.AssistantMessageDecision{
        ReplaceText: strings.ReplaceAll(text, "SECRET", "[redacted]"),
    }
})
```

See:
- `examples/extensions/hello/` — slash commands
- `examples/extensions/clock/` — slash commands in plain Node, no SDK
- `examples/extensions/weather/` — LLM-callable tool
- `examples/extensions/guard/` — event subscriptions + tool-call
  interception (refuses dangerous bash patterns)
- `examples/extensions/todo/` — interactive persistent panel + tool
- `examples/extensions/scratchpad/` — source-run TypeScript commands + tool

### Hot reload

Type `/reload-ext` in the TUI to tear down every running extension
subprocess, re-read the manifests from disk, and respawn the set.
The agent's tool registry is rebuilt automatically, so freshly-
registered extension tools become callable without restarting zot.
Useful while developing an extension: edit, save, `/reload-ext`,
done. Explicit `--ext` paths are remembered and reloaded alongside
discovered extensions.

### TypeScript / Python

These SDKs aren't in the main repo yet; the wire format is small
enough that a `~30 line` raw script gets you started in either
language. See the [Quick start](#quick-start) Python example for the
shape. SDK packages will land in follow-up commits.

## Security

Extensions run with **the user's full filesystem and network
permissions**. Treat installing an extension the same as installing
any other binary on your machine.

`zot ext install <git-url>` clones from any URL you give it. There's
no sandbox in v1; if you need isolation, install only extensions you
trust or run zot under your platform's sandboxing tool (`bwrap` /
`sandbox-exec` / AppContainer).

## Roadmap

Phase 1 (shipped):
- [x] subprocess lifecycle + hello handshake
- [x] `register_command` + `command_invoked`
- [x] `notify`
- [x] `zot ext` CLI

Phase 2 (shipped):
- [x] `register_tool` + `tool_call` + `tool_result`
- [x] `ready` sentinel for safe agent-registry build timing
- [x] tool result attribution surfaces extension name in details

Phase 3 (shipped):
- [x] event subscriptions (`session_start`, `turn_start`, `turn_end`,
      `tool_call`, `assistant_message`)
- [x] tool-call interception (block before execution)

Phase 4 (shipped):
- [x] interception for `turn_start` and `assistant_message` (in
      addition to `tool_call`)
- [x] modify tool args mid-flight via `modified_args`
- [x] rewrite user-visible assistant text via `replace_text`
- [x] `/reload-ext` slash command (hot-reload without restarting zot)

Future (no firm timeline):
- [ ] TypeScript and Python SDK packages (currently the wire format
      is stable enough to hand-roll, see the Python quick-start)
- [ ] HTTP / WebSocket transport variants (today: subprocess stdio)
- [ ] per-extension permission scopes (today: full user privileges)
